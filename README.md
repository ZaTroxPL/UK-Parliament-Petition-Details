# UK-Parliament-Petition-Details
View details of a Parliament Petition in the UK

So, turns out that you can get additional data about a petition from a petition.parliament.uk website. <br>
The additional data is provided in a JSON format, so I decided to create this little Web App to display that additional information.

<strike>(can't get AWS to work with my domain for some reason, so this will have to do for now)</strike> <br>
<strike>(turns out when getting a .co.uk domain, your data needs to be verified by Nominet, so that may take a while)</strike> <br>

<strong>How to get Petition ID:</strong>

Go to the <a href="http://petition.parliament.uk">petition.parliament.uk</a> website and click on a petition you would like to know more about.
Once you have picked the petition, the Petition ID will be at the end of the URL, like this: petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300336. The 300336 is the Petition ID.
